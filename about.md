  The opinions in this blog are mine and mine alone, based on little more than my own personal experience
  and the influences in my life to date (whether organic or written).  I strongly believe everyone is
  entitled to their opinions, and respectful discussion of dissenting viewpoints is how we continue
  to learn and grow.  You have been warned.

Welcome to my blog.  Wow, that sounds weird.  I forever swore to myself I'd never sink to blogging...not because blogging itself is evil in some way, but because of a few biases I needed to overcome:

1. Coming from a Web 1.0 world where this sort of thing would have been built from scratch, part of me felt blogging just wasn't geeky enough when based on canned "platforms".
2. Information security is an ongoing hobby...  I have a day job that I devote a lot of time to, do I need to spend extra time ensuring my "blogging platform" has all the relevant security updates?
3. I've always quietly wondered, "Who in the world needs to hear yet another OPINION?!?"

Finding Jekyll addressed #1 for me, since I can now "blog like a hacker"...  it's just fun mixing up YAML, HTML, templating, git and all the other technologies inolved.

As it turns out, Jekyll also helped alleviate #2...it's not for everyone, but I much prefer template-based generation of static content.  No databases, no PHP...  fewer moving parts, less surface area to worry about in a hostile world.

Last but not least...  opinions are like noses, most people have them!  This required a slight change of perspective on my part.  If someone actually finds one of my many opions useful, so be it, but the larger reason for collecting interesting things in a version-controlled, searchable archive is to supplement my own shoddy memory.  :-)
