Today is Thanksgiving...  so I did the only sensible thing, and carefully avoided any shopping or discounts to instead take time to introspect).

First and foremost, I am extremely grateful for my family.  The past couple years have included a lot of personal losses, and spending the day eating way too much with my wife, grandmother, mother, aunts and uncles was truly the biggest blessing possible.  When spattered with a handful of phone calls to more distant relatives and long-time friends, it needed little else to be the most amazing day of the year (and I haven't even mentioned smoked turkey or the table full of desserts that I'm still recovering from as I write this!).

## Getting Deep

That said, I wanted to reflect on the latest calamity to strike my tiny corner of the universe.  This year I got laid off from a megacorp I'd devoted over a decade of my life to.  I never thought I'd be anywhere that long (or work for a megacorp in the first place, it was courtesy of a startup acquisition), but it was a fun ride where I got to meet a small army of amazing humans while hopping across a few different teams managing distributed systems and building cloud services in various shapes and sizes.

I got the news a few weeks ago while traveling to celebreate by wife's brother's birthday...  as fate would have it, the call came in right as we were on the way to the party.  It came as a total shock, with no advance warning (that would have endangered stock prices I'm told), and was announced rather curtly over a really awkward phone call.  Lots of questions immediately sprang to mind...  How are we going to pay our mortgage?  What about healthcare?  Why do this right before the holidays?  I had to choke it down and do the best I could to enjoy the family celebration.  It was hard, and I admittedly felt pretty down and wasn't able to sleep for several days.

Last night I packaged up the corporate laptop to ship back, which may be seen as the final nail in the coffin...  but the more I reflect, the more I've come to see this experience as hugely positive.  Change is often described as scary, but without change there can be no growth.  In the words of John F. Kennedy, "Those who dare to fail miserably can achieve greatly."

## How Long is Too Long?

Part of my treipidation was situational, and part my own fault...  During my tour of duty at megacorp, I began working remotely full-time.  I'd never had to search for remote work during a job transition before, and to make matters worse had moved to a very remote part of the country to be closer to aging family.  When I got the news, I was paranoid I would never find another remote-friendly opportunity again, particularly in light of recent stories around other megacorps trimming back their remote workforce.

The part that was my fault was simply staying in one place too long...  at a young age my father instilled not to change posistions too quickly.  "It'll look like you can't commit to anything."  The flip side he didn't share, was it's also bad to stay in one place too long!  Changing positions, even if leveraging similar technologies, causes you to learn nuances of the environment (not to mention getting to know new people, and honing invaluable soft skills).  While I had thankfully transistioned to several teams with different focuses, my paranoia grew even larger when I started over analyzing how being in one place so long might look to new employers.  Even worse, going so long without interviewing doesn't do much for one's confidence -- and make no mistake, interviewing is a skill that languishes without practice like any other!

## Change is a Blessing

Enough melodrama!  The point of laying out the seemingly negative, is to accentuate the positive...

While the initial conversations were anxiety-ridden, practice makes perfect.  Each conversation got easier and felt more natural, the resume got increasingly polished along with my social profiles, and I took time to learn new skills and polish some that had languished...  interviewing was a lot like TDD and CI/CD -- providing a continuous feedback loop allowing me to learn and improve!

The search itself was inspiring.  Quite the opposite of my initial fear, there were countless remote-friendly (and often remote-first) positions at amazing comapanies of all sizes.  Innovative companies I'd often dreamed of working for were offering positions where I could leverage existing skills while learning many I coveted.  In fact, the hard part wasn't finding positions...  it was sorting through them all, managing resume submissions and following up!

Add to all this that megacorp has a habit of laying off hundreds (often thousands) of employees every quarter -- all capable, devoted, hard-working individuals -- and I have to consider myself extremely fortunate not to have been let go even sooner.  Regardless of how the layoff itself is perceived, a decade of paychecks and hefty bonuses helped move me closer to family, finance a house, and provided much-needed medical care for my family.

So looking back, loosing a "sure thing" that paid more than I ever thought possible to make doing something I love was not only a thing to be thankful for...  it was the best thing to happen to me professionally.  It opened my eyes to a previously unimagined world of opportunity.  The conversations I've had have taught me so much, and the chance to become part of something new that I am genuinely excited about has reignited the love of technology that got me started in this industry over twenty years ago.

Happy Thanksgiving!
