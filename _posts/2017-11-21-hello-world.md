As the name implies, this is my first attempt at a blog post created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)...  be afraid, be VERY afraid!

For anyone interested in a similar diversion...  The mobile-friendly theme is [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), and here's [an awesome read to get started](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages) if you've never played with Jekyl before (while based around a different theme, it's a thorough overview of the setup and publishing process).

Last but not least, [this blog post](http://shahrajat.com/2016-06-22-install-jekyll-subdirectory-blog-github-pages) gives a nice summary of steps to get your GitHub Pages blog served from a convenient sub-directory of your GitHub Pages based website (if, like me, you want to host static pages on your front page).

Stay tuned for more earth shattering posts!
