As the name implies, this is my first attempt at a blog post created using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyl</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>...  be afraid, be VERY afraid! The mobile-friendly theme is <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">Lanyon</a>, and here's <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">a good read to get started</a> if you've never played with Jekyl before.  Last but not least, <a
href="http://shahrajat.com/2016-06-22-install-jekyll-subdirectory-blog-github-pages">this blog post</a> gives nice summary of steps to get your GitHub Pages blog served from a convenient sub-directory.  Stay tuned for more earth shattering posts!
