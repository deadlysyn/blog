# Node Health Checks

Hi folks!  I've neglected this blog lately...  I was never happy with the
readily available themes or publishing workflow, and the idea of developing
my own got usurped by other priorities including a lot of travel and a job
search.  Lately, the excuses have turned into plain laziness.  It's just too
easy to publish on [Medium](https://medium.com/@deadlysyn).  While I'm not
completely sold on locking content behind a paywall, the clean interface and
network of great content are really appealing to me.  Some rainy day, my hope
is to migrate to [Ghost](https://ghost.org).  I really like how that project's
come together, as well as their values.

That said, for any who might be watching, I wanted to share a recent post I
did on health check endpoints for [Node](https://nodejs.org) apps.  Rather
than re-post here in its entirety,
[I'll just share this link](https://itnext.io/node-health-checks-b25a6c62d990).
Enjoy!
